# Creating an overlay over a container

sudo lxc-copy --name base --newname fork --snapshot --backingstorage overlay

Work process:
* The runner (the one that reads the Cockerfile) receives the desired container name along with the path to the Cockerfile
* The runner retrieves the base container name from the Cockerfile's base builder executable (through its stdout)
* The runner creates a child container (overlayfs) from the base (name: "${desired container name}-layer{N}")
* The runner passes that container in an env var to the script
* The container is being created with the name "${desired container name}" from the last layer
